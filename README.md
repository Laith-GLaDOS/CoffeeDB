# Laith-GLaDOS/CoffeeDB
CoffeeDB is a blazingly-fast key-value store  
It does all key-value operations in RAM but it saves changes to disk after committing in RAM so that when CoffeeDB is restarted, the keys persist

# Notes:
 - This is a WIP (Work In Progress)

# Docs
CoffeeDB v1.0.0 is not done yet so no docs at the moment
